## üìä Testing Environments

### Local Development
```bash
# Standard development
npm run dev

# Production build testing
npm run build
npm run serve:dist
```

### Screen Size Testing
Test these breakpoints:
- **320px** - Small mobile
- **375px** - iPhone SE

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Performance Issues
```bash
# Check file sizes
ls -lh *.css *.js *.html

# Analyze bundle
npm run build
ls -lh dist/
```

**Solutions:**
- Optimize images (WebP format)
- Minify CSS/JS files
- Remove unused code
- Enable compression

### Accessibility Issues
```bash
# Run accessibility audit
npm run test:accessibility

# Check specific issues
# Use browser dev tools accessibility panel
```

**Common fixes:**
- Add alt text to images
- Include proper ARIA labels
- Fix color contrast issues
- Improve keyboard navigation

### Cross-Browser Issues
**CSS Issues:**
- Add vendor prefixes
- Use feature queries (@supports)
- Provide fallbacks for new features

**JavaScript Issues:**
- Use feature detection
- Add polyfills for older browsers
- Test with different JavaScript engines

## üìà Test Reporting

### Generate Reports
```bash
# Create reports directory
mkdir -p reports

# Run comprehensive testing
npm run test > reports/test-results.txt
npm run test:performance
npm run test:accessibility > reports/accessibility.txt
```

### CI/CD Integration
The GitHub Actions workflow automatically:
- Runs tests on every push/PR
- Generates performance reports
- Comments on PRs with results
- Blocks merging if tests fail

## üéØ Testing Best Practices

### Development Testing
1. **Test as you code** - Don't wait until the end
2. **Use real devices** - Emulators aren't always accurate
3. **Test edge cases** - Slow networks, old devices
4. **Focus on user experience** - Not just technical metrics

### Accessibility Testing
1. **Test with real users** - Include users with disabilities
2. **Use multiple tools** - Automated + manual testing
3. **Test early** - Accessibility is easier to build in than bolt on
4. **Document issues** - Keep track of known limitations

### Performance Testing
1. **Test on slow devices** - Don't just use high-end hardware
2. **Monitor over time** - Performance can degrade
3. **Test real-world conditions** - Slow networks, high CPU usage
4. **Optimize for mobile** - Mobile-first performance approach
